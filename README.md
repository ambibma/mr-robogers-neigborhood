step 1 Business 
Input: Application will take some number (string)
-The string will be converted into an array * = utility
-The array will be converted into numbers *= utility 
-The array will be checked for all digits containing  1s,2s, and 3s,
  -if digit has a 1 = boop
  -if digit has 1 & 2 = "beep"
  -if digit has 1 & 2 & 3 = "Won't you be my neighbor"

Step 2 UI logic
-web api will have an input box form to input string number
-app will have a submit button for the form that runs beepBoop()
-the array will then create <ul> tag and <li> tag in which every element will be appended into
-a button will exist to refresh page to take new input


Output: App will return a list of values from 0 => user's inputted number 
where all digits that contain a 1, are replaced with "Beep". 
All Numbers that contain 2 will be replaced with "Boop!" 
All numbers that contain a 3 are replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor"
